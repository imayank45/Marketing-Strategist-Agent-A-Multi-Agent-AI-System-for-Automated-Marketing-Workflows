# Marketing-Strategist-Agent-A-Multi-Agent-AI-System-for-Automated-Marketing-Workflows
Built an automated multi-agent AI Marketing Strategist system using LangChain, RAG, and Streamlit to predict customer subscription likelihood and generate optimized campaign strategies for the banking domain.

🌟 Overview

The Marketing Strategist Agent is a Streamlit-based AI system designed to automate marketing strategy creation using a multi-agent architecture.
It combines:

A trained Logistic Regression model for customer conversion prediction

Three LLM-powered agents (strategy, review, optimization)

A central orchestrator to coordinate reasoning

A clean and modular production-ready folder structure

Users input customer features, and the system automatically:

Predicts conversion probability

Generates a marketing strategy

Reviews and evaluates the strategy

Produces a final optimized strategy

This project demonstrates strong skills in machine learning, LLM agents, full-stack development, reasoning pipelines, and product design—perfect for showcasing to recruiters.

🎯 Features

🤖 Multi-Agent AI Pipeline: Predictor → Strategist → Reviewer → Optimizer

📈 Conversion Prediction Model: Logistic Regression built on banking marketing dataset

🧠 Strategy Generation: GPT-4o-mini creates personalized marketing actions

📝 Strategy Review Engine: Highlights strengths, weaknesses, and gives a score

🔧 Strategy Optimization: Final polished output based on reviewer feedback

🖥️ Streamlit UI: Clean interface with editable customer feature inputs

🔗 Modular Architecture: Each agent is a standalone module

⚙️ Environment-Based LLM Support: Reads API key from .env

📦 Installation
Prerequisites

🐍 Python 3.9+

📦 pip
 
🔑 OpenAI API Key

🧠 Multi-Agent System Architecture
1️⃣ Predictor Agent

Loads the ML model

Arranges user data in predefined feature order

Returns:

- probability
- decision (0/1)
- raw preprocessed data

2️⃣ Strategy Agent

Converts probability into a focused marketing strategy.

Example:

Customer has medium probability of conversion.
Actions:
- Send personalized follow-up email
- Highlight interest-specific product features

3️⃣ Reviewer Agent

Evaluates the initial strategy and returns:

- Positive points
- Weaknesses
- Overall score


Example:

Strengths: Clear messaging.
Weaknesses: Lacks long-term nurturing workflow.
Score: 7.5/10

4️⃣ Optimizer Agent

Refines the strategy using reviewer feedback.

Example:

Final optimized strategy:
- Add 14-day follow-up loop
- Provide targeted EMI calculator
- Include personalization in SMS and email cadences

💻 Technical Details
Backend

Streamlit

Python 3.9

dotenv for secure API key loading

Machine Learning

Logistic Regression

Predefined feature ordering

Pickle model loading

LLM Agents

Model: gpt-4o-mini

Used for strategy generation, feedback, and optimization

Lightweight, low-latency LLM calls

Pipeline Execution

Orchestrator connects all four agents

Each agent is modular and replaceable

No tight coupling between agents

⚠️ Limitations

🤖 LLM output depends on API key availability

📉 Dummy/placeholder model may reduce accuracy if not replaced

📄 Strategies are AI-generated, not domain-certified

🌐 Internet required for OpenAI API calls

🚀 Future Improvements

📊 Add visualizations (probability trends, feature importance)

🧪 Add A/B Testing recommendations

🗄 Move ML model to ONNX / MLflow

💬 Add conversational UI for strategy changes

📚 Add historical customer database

🔧 Add caching for agent responses
